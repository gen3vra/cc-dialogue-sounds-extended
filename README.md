# CrossCode Dialogue Sounds Extended Mod
#### [Download the latest release](https://github.com/gen3vra/cc-dialogue-sounds-extended/releases/latest)

Adds new dialogue sounds for most main characters. This mod replaces the 'beep' sound that repetitively plays during dialogue with a variety of sounds that are more fitting to the character speaking. 

Experimental; pull requests / suggestions for sound updates are welcome
